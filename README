## All files:	
	popser.cpp, Makefile, md5.cpp, md5.h, README, manual.pdf

## Usage: 
./popser [-h] [-a PATH] [-c] [-p PORT] [-d PATH] [-r]
			-h: prints help text
			-a: path to the authentication file
			-c: enable cleartext authentication
			-p: port number
			-d: path to the Maildir folder
			-r: reset server
			
## Requirements:
	The Makefile requires a gcc with support of the <experimental/filesystem> library.
	
## Extensions:
	This implementation also supports the optional TOP command.
	
## Contributions:
	The md5 hash functions in files md5.cpp and md5.h come from http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-md5-function.
	The majority of the "connection()" function's code comes from the ISA examplary echo-server2.cpp file from https://wis.fit.vutbr.cz/FIT/st/course-files-st.php.cs?file=%2Fcourse%2FISA-IT%2Fexamples&cid=12191
	The author of this project does not claim authorship of these two parts of the project.
